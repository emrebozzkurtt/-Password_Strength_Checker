#                          **Password Strength Checker**



#### **Project Overview**

##### 

##### The Password Strength Checker is a desktop-based security application developed using Python and Tkinter. The project helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords in real time and provides actionable suggestions to improve password security. It visually represents password strength using a progress bar and labels such as Weak, Medium, and Strong, making it easy for users to understand password quality. The application also includes features like password generation, password visibility toggle, and dark mode support for enhanced usability.

##### 

#### **Objectives**

##### 

##### The primary objectives of this project are:

##### 

##### To analyze user-entered passwords based on security standards

##### 

##### To classify password strength clearly and visually

##### 

##### To guide users with suggestions to create strong passwords

##### 

##### To promote better cybersecurity practices

##### 

#### **Technology Stack**

##### 

##### Programming Language: Python

##### 

##### GUI Framework: Tkinter (with ttk)

##### 

##### Libraries Used: re, random, string

##### 

##### Platform: Windows (Desktop Application)

##### 

#### **System Functionality**

##### 

##### The application evaluates passwords using multiple criteria including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Each satisfied condition contributes to a score that determines the password strength. A progress bar dynamically updates to reflect the score, while color indicators (red, orange, green) provide instant feedback. If the password is weak or medium, the system displays suggestions to improve it. For strong passwords, a confirmation message is shown. The built-in password generator creates secure random passwords automatically.

#####
